## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the WinRAR Auto-Installer Script, we encourage you to let us know as soon as possible. We welcome reports from everyone, including security researchers, developers, and users. Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose**: To help us effectively manage security reports, we ask that you do not share details of the vulnerability in public forums, social media, or elsewhere.

2. **Email Your Report**: Please send your report via email to [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com). Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including how it can be reproduced. If possible, provide scripts, screenshots, or other materials that could help us understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability.

3. **Wait for Initial Assessment**: We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours. Our security team will conduct an initial assessment and may contact you for further information.

4. **Collaboration**: If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work with you to assess the impact and coordinate disclosure and patching of the issue. We appreciate your patience and collaboration during this process.
